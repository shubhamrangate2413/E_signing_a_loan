# E_signing_a_loan

The aim of this project is to provide a practical overview of the general DS/ML workflow, which is becoming an increasingly popular framework upon which modern-day actuarial pricing methods are being built. Accurate prediction of loan approvals is currently one of the most crucial challenges that businesses across the industry are facing, where providing accurate estimates of loan approvals is vital to ensuring a person has a good background history of loan and investments, especially as the sector is currently experiencing a swelling volume of claims - for example, regarding business interruption - as one of the major consequences of COVID-19.

As a case study, we will introduce some supervised ML techniques. we have trained our dataset for all possible classification models and selected the best classifier.
